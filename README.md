# Google Hash Code 2019 Python
 Solution to the google hash code 2019 in Python. The total score is 3570614 divided has in the table below.


|       File      |  Score  |
|:---------------:|:-------:|
|   a_example.in  |    60   |
|   b_narrow.in   | 1346790 |
|   c_urgent.in   | 1312825 |

| e_intriguing.in |    1    |
|     f_big.in    |  840971 |

The solution is based on tree data structure.

## Requirements
The solver 3 (the final one) require the [networkx](https://networkx.org/) package and the [scipy](https://scipy.org/) package to work.
If you have any problem install them with conda 
```python
conda install -c anaconda scipy

conda install -c anaconda networkx 
```

## Notes
The solver is still (somehow) bugged and sometimes with file *d_typical* has caused problem with dependencies. For the other files I don't have seen this any error (for now).
The creation time of the solution is quite big for file b and c.
